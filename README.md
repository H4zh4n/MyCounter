**WHAT'S NEW IN 1.0.20?** <br>

• View Daily Activity for your entire lists with a pie chart.<br>
• Increment/Decrement with a Custom date/time for history. for times you forget to increment/decrement something and wish to be precise about it's date/time.<br>
• Multiply your counter value by a number for display purposes. This is good for counters that you use to count the times an activity occurred  [for example how many cigarettes you smoke]. you can then multiply the value by it's price to estimate how much you spend.<br>
• Redesigned navigation menu to indicate better which list is selected.<br>
• Moved the Add Counter button to a floating menu which has Daily Activity as-well.<br>
• Some more code-base improvements  and bug fixes.<br>
